/ Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

num1 = 10
num2 = 20
sum = num1+num2
print str(sum)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

number = input(int('Enter a number'))
if 
    number / 2 
    print ("This is an Even Number")
    else
    print ("This is Odd number")

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.  
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

numbers= (4,6,31,14,17)

//Calculate average 

average = sum(numbers)/len(numbers)
 

//smallest & largest

smallest_num = minimum(numbers)
largest_num = maximum(numbers)

//results from above
average = 14.4
smallest = 4
largest = 31
